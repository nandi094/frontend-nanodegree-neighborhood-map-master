## Neighbourhood Map Project

The project is very different and difficult one faced by me over this font end nanodegree course.
Working with knockout.js was fun as it makes life easier.
The Documentation Provided to the implementation of this is very useful and very handy in situations where we get struck in the project.

### Getting started
- Firstly **Unzip** the project folder
- Then open the *index.html* file
- Then search for the **Beautiful Places in Bengaluru** which is provided in The list
- Click on the link That pops up to have better Information
- Try the street view *this is amazing*
- I have used Bootstrap to make columns simpler
